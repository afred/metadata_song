_to the tune of Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen_


```
The data's scattered everyplace
in every kind of database
Excel, MySQL, and FileMaker
Duplication everywhere
But none of the IDs are shared
How will I ever merge this metadata?

metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata

[for the] longest time our only plan
[was to] take a million files and
ingest 'em all and try to fix 'em later
i stand before you and confess
i helped contribute to this messy
pile of tangled, mangled metadata

metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata

Perhaps a better a job awaits
with better digs and better pay,
maybe in some start-up incubator.
But if this problem goes unsolved
Our history will be dissolved
with no one there to save the metadata

metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata
